A collection of classic arcade games built with vanilla JavaScript, featuring a shared game engine, unified input system, procedurally generated audio, and PWA support for installability.

## Features

- **Shared Game Engine** — `Engine` class provides a unified game loop, canvas management with responsive `fit` scaling, and drawing primitives (`rect`, `circle`, `text`)
- **Unified Input** — `Input` class normalises keyboard, mouse, and multi-touch events into a single API with gesture detection (swipe) and just-pressed/released semantics
- **Procedural Audio** — `Audio` class synthesises sounds at runtime (square, sine, saw, noise waves with envelope shaping); no external audio files required
- **Hub Page** — Minimalist game grid reads `games.json` and auto-renders game cards with thumbnails, descriptions, and a Play button; fully responsive (auto-fill grid, 1 col on mobile)
- **Auto-Discovery** — `scripts/scan-games.js` scans the `games/` directory and updates `games.json` automatically. This runs via a GitHub Workflow on every push.
- **PWA (Hybrid Cache)** — Service worker uses a hybrid strategy: Network-First for core hub files (`index.html`, `games.json`, etc.) to ensure new games appear immediately when online, and Cache-First for static assets and manually saved game files.
- **Dark Mode** — Full dark theme (`#0f0f1a` background) with a consistent red/purple accent palette across the hub and all games
- **AI Opponent** — Tic Tac Toe features an AI that plays optimally; Arkanoid and Snake are single-player with progressive difficulty

## Adding a New Game

1. Create a new folder under `games/` with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2. Use the shared engine via `<script>` tags:
   ```html
   <script src="../../engine/input.js"></script>
   <script src="../../engine/audio.js"></script>
   <script src="../../engine/engine.js"></script>
   ```
3. Push your changes. A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run `scripts/scan-games.js` to update `games.json` and deploy it to GitHub Pages. You can also run it locally via `node scripts/scan-games.js`.

Each game directory is self-contained and can be opened independently — the engine is loaded via relative paths.

## Setup

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. The hub lists all registered games; click any card to play.
